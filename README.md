1. Asyncronous_machine_DTC: DTC (direct torque control) of an asyncronous machine. (Simulink)
2. Active_filter_repetitive_controller: master's thesis. I realized a control of an active filter (a system designed to eliminate harmonic disturbs in the current lines) implementing several architectures of repetitive controllers. (Simulink)
3. Indirect_field_oriented_control: control of an induction machine using a indirect method to implement the flux observer. (Simulink)
